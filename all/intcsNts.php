<h1>Donation Payment Terms & Conditions</h1></br>


These Terms and Conditions apply separately to each single donation that you make. </br>
Except as provided for in section 6, ‘Regular Donations', and unless specified by you, they</br>
do not form a contract allowing for future or successive transactions to be set up. By confirming </br>
on the Website that you wish to make a donation you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions </br>
for that donation.


<h2>(1) The donation services</h2></br>

 

We will use your donation at our discretion but within our stated charitable objectives.</br>


All payments through the Website are to be made by payment card. We also accept donations by </br>
cheque. Cheques can be made payable to Stop the Traffik and sent to 75 Westminster Bridge Road, London,</br> 
SE1 7HS, UK. Please note that we do not accept payment by cash.


Once you confirm to us through the Website that you wish to proceed with your donation your transaction </br>
will be processed through our payment services provider, WorldPay. By confirming that you wish to proceed</br> 
with your donation you authorise Worldpay to request funds from your credit or debit card provider. </br>
Worldpay will only process your donation in pounds sterling, US dollars, Australian dollars and Euros.</br>


<h2>(2) Gift aid</h2>


When you donate to us through our Website and confirm that you are a UK taxpayer in accordance with the</br>
 requirements of the Gift Aid scheme as they apply from time to time, we can reclaim Gift Aid. It is your</br>
 responsibility to ascertain whether you qualify for Gift Aid entitlement. If you have any doubts about </br>
your entitlement for Gift Aid we recommend you consult your own advisors or HMRC about any accounting,</br>
 taxation or financial consequences of making a donation that may affect you. Further information on gift </br>
aid can be found at http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/individuals/giving/gift-aid.htm.</br>


<h2>(3) Unauthorised card use</h2>

 

If you become aware of fraudulent use of your card, or if it is lost or stolen, you must notify your card provider.

 

<h2>(4) Information from you</h2>

 

Before we can process a donation you must provide us with (i) your name, address and email address; and </br>
(ii) details of the credit or debit card that you wish to use to fund the donation. We will use this information </br>
to process your donation. It is your responsibility to ensure you have provided us with the correct information.</br>

 

When you submit your payment details, these details will be transferred to our payment provider, Worldpay, and your</br>
 payment data will be collected and processed securely by them. You should make sure that you are aware of Worldpay's</br>
 terms and conditions, which are different from our own, to ensure that you are comfortable with how they will process</br>
 your personal data before you make a donation.</br>

 

We won't share your personal details with any other third party other than is set out in our Privacy Policy. Our Privacy</br>
 Policy forms part of these Donation Payment Terms and Conditions and by agreeing to these Terms and Conditions you are also</br>
 agreeing to the way we use and protect your personal information in line with our Privacy Policy.</br>

 

<h2>(5) Refund policy</h2>

 

If you make an error in your donation please contact us either by email at info@stopthetraffik.org, by phone at 020 7921 4250 or </br>
by post at Stop The Traffik, 75 Westminster Bridge Road, London, SE1 7HS within 14 days and a full refund will be made to you.</br>

 

<h2>(6) Regular donations</h2>

 

These Donation Payment Terms and Conditions will only apply to successive donations made through the Website where you have set up a
 regular donation. When you set up a regular donation you will be scheduling a series of donations to be made on the day of the month 
that you choose for the period of time you selected or until further notice. You agree that these Terms and Conditions will apply to each of the donations in that series.

 

By confirming that you wish to proceed with a regular donation you authorise our payment service provider Worldpay to request funds from your credit or debit card on the day of each month that you set.

 

To cancel your regular donation please contact us at info@stopthetraffik.org. Alternatively directions on how to cancel your regular donation online via WorldPay can be found here http://www.worldpay.com/shopper/kb/shoppermanagementsystem/sms4400.html.

 

<h2>(7) General</h2>

 

We reserve the right to amend these Donation Payment Terms and Conditions at any time.

 

These Donation Payment Terms and Conditions are governed by English law and are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts
