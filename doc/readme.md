**#Business description#**		
		
**_Our 60s_** is a stock exchange company where our revenue is generated through the means of music from the 1960s'. 		
We are established in south Africa Johannesburg founded in 14 January 2000.We		
 plan to extend our opportunity by building an e-commerce  website. That give consumer a chance		
 to view different genre of music weighing from pop rock n roll and even to posters.We sell		
our products in bulk so the target market are retail stores and yet accommodate items		
 to be sold on auction and sales on certain products for individual consumers.The 		
 form in which the items come in are "cassette,CDS,record-players and posters.		
We are also involved in charity work,where we tend to open window for donations 		
form ordinary consumers, whereby they will be used to fund music schools in Johannesburg (strengthening South Africa talent).	
		
**#Prime functionality/objectives of the project#***		
		
##The goals of the website##		
		
The website will be constructed in a way that it will allow future improvements and modification making use		
of object oriented language in php(Hypertext Preprocessor). The whole aim is design a website that has the		
capabilities of shopping cart. That means a user is allowed to purchase products or services on-line which would involve 		
ordinary daily transaction but in more advance and secured way. This leads us to the concept that all transactions		
will still provide the generation of invoice and email notification (something new). What this system will be able to do is		
produce reports and sale summaries, customers order history.		
		
###Customers benefits###		
		
They will be able to view their order history and order statuses. Being privileged to		
maintaining and updating their accounts. Allow them to perform their search of items sufficiently and accurately		
. Another important feature is to view the products and listen to them without having to walk to an actual store. We are		
to offer a user friendly interface that is easy to learn and use at the same time converting them to be returned visitors		
to loyal customers to the company. Mainly the we be able to register and become members and have membership price		
instead of regular pricing on products and services.		
		
###Administrator benefits###		
		
They have the right manipulate the content of the website, such as changing prices of products (update),removing items they		
no longer want to sell (deleting) and have new items added to the catalogue (adding). A number of user can be giving access		
to certain pages which covers the idea of user privileges. They can monitor the progress of the revenue in the company as well		
as their products and services all under statistics. An important feature is contacting our customers by the means		
of emails and newsletter or even directly, this will strengthen the relationship.		
		
###Potential market and competitors###		
		
Out potential market are retail stores,public consumers,music warehouses. Our competitors would be international business that		
would provide similar services as us in terms of, selling single CD's instead of bulk.Another type of competitors are the free		
download of music on-line which does not involve a user registering on to the site. Another competitor are regular consumers		
that could by the music and break the copy licence and have them distributed in different formats on the street market.		
		
###Marketing methods###		
		
Firstly we allow our customer to order on line and have the products shipped to them.  And products		
on-line have discounted percentages and for products bought in bulk do have discounted percentages too.		
Secondly we only allow them to listen or download a sample of the specified product free for charge.		
 Now how we tend to promote our company is the means of having banners on other stores.We tend to have a sales staff		
that will ensure that all strategies are implemented.But our whole goal is to make the public know		
that we are as reliable as brick and mortar companies.
